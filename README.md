# Skin Condition Identification Using RCNN

## Introduction

Skin issues, ranging from cosmetic concerns to serious dermatological conditions, significantly impact both aesthetics and overall health. The accurate identification of skin problems, particularly in detecting various skin layers, poses a substantial challenge. Leveraging advanced technologies, particularly deep learning, can enhance the identification and management of these conditions.

## Overview

This study explores the efficacy of the RCNN model in addressing these challenges using the HAM10000 dataset. Initially, the RCNN model demonstrated gradual improvement over 10 epochs, with testing accuracies rising from 65.31% to 68.00% and validation accuracy from 67.00% to 67.40%. During fine-tuning over 100 epochs, the RCNN model showed significant advancements, achieving a testing accuracy of 89.44% and a validation accuracy of 82.28%.

These results highlight the potential of AI in improving skin condition identification and management, promoting better healthcare outcomes. Future research should focus on refining these models, mitigating biases, and integrating AI tools into real-world healthcare settings to ensure their practical application. Collaboration between AI researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers is crucial to effectively harness the power of AI in dermatology.
